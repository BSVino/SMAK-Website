<div style="width: 60%;"><h2>Developing SMAK</h2>

<p>SMAK is "Free/Open Source Software" meaning that the source code is available for you to download and compile for yourself. This also means that you can help add features to SMAK! Here's what you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A compiler. If you run Windows, you need <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+studio+express">Visual Studio Express</a>. If you're running Linux, you need GCC.</li>
<li>A little knowledge of C++.</li>
<li>A copy of Git.</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://github.com/BSVino/SMAK/blob/master/README.md">these instructions on how to build SMAK</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once all of that is ready, you're ready to go! Once you're done coding, just send me a patch through GitHub.</p>

<p>Okay, in truth all of that stuff is hard and I made it sound easy. But if you need any help, <a href="mailto:jorge@lunarworkshop.com">just ask</a>.</p>
